OOP = Object-Oriented Paradigm:

1) Think of every object will provide "list of services" which are specified in its interface

2) Class Diagram:
   - Class is a model, template, blue-print which object is created from
   - Modifiers are used to indicate visibility of attributes:
          + : public
          # : protected
          - : private
          ~ : default
